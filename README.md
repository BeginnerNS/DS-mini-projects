# DS-mini-projects
Mini projects created using array, stack, queue, linked list, trees and graph as a part of Data Structures course project for 3rd semester using C language.

### Departmental store using array
In this project, we created a department store where customers could purchase everything they wanted, including fruits, electronics, clothing, and medicines. We have designed several functions for certain choices, and once a user selects one, he is allowed to purchase a variety of items. The final step displays a cart with everything the user chooses.

### Music Playlist using stack
This project uses a stack to create a playlist that operates on the last in, first out principle. Songs are played one at a time, and we also created a function that allows us to remove songs from the stack. The code can also indicate whether the stack is full or empty when adding or playing a song from the stack. Every song has a set amount of time allotted to it. When a playlist is created, it shows the total time required to hear every song.

### Hotel management system using queue
In this project, we created a hotel management system that gives the user the ability to reserve a room, examine the status of available rooms, and even cancel a reservation. Lastly, the user can view the filled rooms in a file.

### Mail Book using linked-list
Mail-book is based on a singly linked list. Mail book has four functions. The first option is "add an email," where the user enters the name and email address he wants to store. The second option is to delete an email. If the user types in the name of the recipient and the email is stored in the mailbook, the email is deleted. Additionally, we have the option of searching for emails by providing a person's name, and lastly, we have used file handling to show the mail book in a .txt file

### Maze Runner Game using Tree
We have made a game using the foundation as a binary tree. The game's name is "Maze Runner". It is a multiplayer game. A maze is generated which has an exit point at a certain node. The player who reaches the exit node in the minimum number of steps wins the game. The maze also has dead ends and the game ends if a player reaches there. The winner is displayed in a .txt file using file handling and the layout of the maze is also displayed.

### Traveling Salesman Problem
The traveling salesman problem (also known as the TSP) asks, "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
The solution to the problem:(solved using graph data structure) To solve the TSP using the Brute-Force method, you must first calculate the total number of routes and then draw and list all of them. Calculate the distance between each route and then select the shortest oneâ€”this is the best option.
